                                        The "Walkability Safety Score" is calculated by combining simulated data points for crime rates, traffic and pedestrian infrastructure, and the proximity of registered sex offenders. Each category contributes to the overall score, providing a holistic view of the walkability safety. Specific weighting and algorithms are simplified for this demonstration.
